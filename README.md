# Challenge-4-Code-Quiz

In This challenge I created a Quiz using mostly JavaScript.

This is a timed Quiz that will start with 75 seconds. Wrong answers will deduct time by 10 seconds. When the Quiz is finished the total time left will judge your score.

I grabbed the questions from https://www.guru99.com/javascript-interview-questions-answers.html. They are common questions that may be asked in an interview.
